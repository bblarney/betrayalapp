## About

This app is intended for Path of Exile players to use as a quick resource to determine best course of action during Immortal Syndicate encounters. The main syndicate table is layed out to provide information on which rewards a player will obtain depending on which safehouse the agent resides in. Users can click table cells to cycle through three colours (green, yellow, red) to correspond with the value of the rewards from that particular combination of agent/safehouse. A 'suggest' button is included to auto populate the table based on the suggested values of each combination (green for very good, yellow for ok, red for bad).
